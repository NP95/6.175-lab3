1. If the throughput is one (i.e. after some time, the output produces an FFT every clock cycle), then the implementation is pipelined; otherwise, it is folded.

2. Both inelastic and elastic pipeline implementations will have a latency of 3 cycles and a result, ideally, every cycle. I'm not entirely sure if there is a way to classify an elastic or inelastic implementation purely on timing of input and output.
